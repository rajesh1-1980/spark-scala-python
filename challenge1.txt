
1 Given a list of words, group the words that are anagrams of each other.

Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters in a different order. For example, "eat" and "tea" are anagrams.

Input:
List("eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat")

Output 

List(
  List("eat", "tea", "ate"),
  List("tan", "nat"),
  List("bat")
)

2 Write a function called filterAndTransform that:

Takes a List[Int]
Takes a filtering function: Int => Boolean
Takes a transforming function: Int => Int
Returns a new list that:
Filters the input list using the filtering function
Transforms the filtered results using the transforming function
You must use higher-order functions like .filter and .map â€” no loops!

3 Write a Scala function that:

Accepts an ArrayBuffer of integers.
Removes all duplicates.
Sorts the result in ascending order.
Returns the modified ArrayBuffer.

4 Problem:
From a list of strings, return names that have length between 3 and 6 (inclusive).

val names = List("Ann", "Bob", "Christine", "Dave", "Eva", "Frank")

5 Given a list of strings, reverse each string and convert it to uppercase.

val words = List("scala", "rocks", "functional", "programming")

6 Given a list of integers, return the sum of only the positive numbers.
val nums = List(-5, 10, -3, 7, 0, 2)
7 Given a list of words, count how many start with the letter "a" (case-insensitive).
val words = List("apple", "banana", "avocado", "grape", "apricot", "melon")
8 Given a list of integers, return a new list containing the square of even numbers only.

val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

9 Find the Second Largest Number in the given list
  val lst = List(10,50,20,60)
